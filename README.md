# Trend Indicator by Forex Robot Easy Team

This code is a sample implementation of the Trend Indicator by Forex Robot Easy Team. The Trend Indicator is designed to analyze price data, identify trends, compare them across different timeframes, and generate trading signals based on the identified trends. It is a versatile tool that can be used to assist traders in making informed trading decisions.

## How It Works

The code defines a class called CTrendIndicator, which encapsulates the functionality of the indicator. It has the following key methods:

### Initialize(timeframes[], symbols[])

This method is used to initialize the indicator with a list of timeframes and symbols. It takes two parameters: an array of timeframes and an array of symbols. The timeframes represent the different time intervals at which the indicator will analyze the price data, and the symbols represent the currency pairs on which the indicator will operate.

### AnalyzeTrends()

This method is responsible for analyzing the price data to identify trends. It contains the implementation logic for trend analysis, which is not provided in the code sample.

### CompareTrends()

This method compares the trends identified across different timeframes. It contains the implementation logic for trend comparison, which is not provided in the code sample.

### GenerateSignals()

This method generates trading signals based on the identified trends. It contains the implementation logic for signal generation, which is not provided in the code sample.

### Buy()

This method executes the buying logic based on the identified trends. It contains the implementation logic for buying, which is not provided in the code sample.

### Sell()

This method executes the selling logic based on the identified trends. It contains the implementation logic for selling, which is not provided in the code sample.

The OnStart() function serves as the entry point of the code. It creates an instance of the CTrendIndicator class and initializes it with a set of timeframes and symbols. It then checks if the indicator is successfully initialized and proceeds to analyze trends, compare them, generate trading signals, and execute buy or sell logic based on the identified trends.
